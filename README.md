Log Analyzer Bot

üìå Project Overview
The Log Analyzer Bot enables developers and support engineers to upload system .log files and receive intelligent summaries, issue detection, and severity-level breakdowns, powered by Google‚Äôs Gemini 1.5 Flash model.
It supports real-time analysis through a user-friendly Streamlit interface and allows follow-up questions for deeper insights. The tool also logs feedback to continuously improve quality and support audit trails.
